# Azulindo

Azulindo is a personal car AI project focused on building an interactive visual interface using **C++ and Raylib**. The project also includes experiments with local AI inference using **llama.cpp**.

The interface is designed to visually react to the AI state, where motion and behavior reflect how the system is processing information.

Below are early test stages of the wave system, which will represent the AI’s emotional and behavioral states through dynamic visual motion.
